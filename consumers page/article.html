				<h3>How to Use Drones for Precision Farming</h3>
				<p>
					Crops can be highly complex, and growing requirements can vary due to slight differences in soil, sunlight, and temperature.  

					Farmers can use drones to track crop fertility and observe exactly where to apply resources like fertilizer and pesticides. Using this data, it's possible to achieve greater consistency and maximize production. </p>

				<h3>The Benefits of Organic Farming</h3>
				<p>Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields.</p>

				<h3>How to Deal with Pests Naturally</h3>
				<p>There's no greater joy for a gardener than a plot full of perfect-looking flowers or vegetables. The problem is that many garden bugs use our flower and vegetable beds as a salad bar. But instead of looking to pesticides for help, you can still have a beautiful garden just by following these simple, natural and cost-effective tips for dealing with garden insect pests. I know they work because my family and I use them both at home and at our wholesale plant business.</p>

				<h3>Crop rotation and soil health</h3>
				<p>
					Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use.</p>

				<h3>Integrated Pest Management</h3>
				<p>
					Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges.</p>

				<h3>Agro Forestry and Permaculture</h3>
				<p>
					Permaculture gardens promote efficiency of space and resources while creating sustainable systems and practices for generations to come.

                    The flexibility of permaculture means families which may not have space for a garden can use their patios, walls or fences, and even indoor spaces as growing areas.</p>
